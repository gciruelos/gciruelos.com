terrible things
tom dooley was a good man
but he had a terrible girlfriend
tom dooley was a confederate soldier
he had sent this girl, laura foster, an engagement ring
she was supposed to be truthfully waiting on him
but she was waiting in a funny kinda way

well, the same thing is going on today while boys in vietnam

tom dooley had this gal's [pitcher?] in his pocket on the battlefield
and every chance he get he take this [pitcher?] out and kiss all over it
while he was kissing all over her [pitcher?] on the battlefield
some other cat back home was kissing all over the gal

tom dooley returned home
on may 1st, 1868
in wilkes county, north carolina

laura foster saw him coming down on the trail on his jackass
you weren't riding in a mustang or thunderbolt like you ride in today
so she had his engagement ring hid in a snuff can
tube rose snuff
matter of fact, this is what made tube rose snuff famous

she saw him coming out in the trail on the jackass
she got his ring and put it on her finger
and polished it off on the skirt
to make it look as if she been wearing it all the time
tom dooley sitting on his jackass
he says: hello, laura
since we now engaged, honey
let's go up on the mountains, in the cabin
on a pre-honeymoon
well you see, nowadays you all go on pre-honeymoons
and don't be engaged
but in 1868 you had to be engaged to a gal to take on a pre-honeymoon

they went up on the mountain on a pre-honeymoon
and he contracted a venereal disease from this girl
and in that day in time
there was no cure for a venereal disease
so he was in a hell of a shape
so was the gal
so tom dooley thought he was doing doing society a good deed
in order to keep the gal from spreading the disease
among others
he took up on the mountain
and killed the hell out of her
