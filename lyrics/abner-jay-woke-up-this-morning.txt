    WOKE UP THIS MORNING
         ABER JAY


woke up this morning
just about the break of day
just woke up
woke up this morning
just about the break of day
i was [?] that pillow
where my baby used to lay

bring me some whiskey
drive this blues away
somebody, somebody
bring me some whiskey
drive this blues away
got the blues this morning
lord knows i have [?]

lord
come back baby
try me one more time
come back, come back
come back, come back baby
try me, try me honey
try me one more time
if my baby don't come back
lord i believe i'll lose my mind
