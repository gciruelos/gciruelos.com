        TO YOU
	   MAYO THOMPSON


like an old shoe
you are the one
with your tongue hanging out
and your laces undone

i have walked and reached half around this world
still i'm dying to get you to come, just be my girl
it might make me sad if i have to go home
[?] in front of the fireplace

like a luckless thief whose pockets are empty
still i love to turn off the light, just to see what you give me

old folks see you walking
they talk to me
they ask me "hey stranger, is that your girl?"
i shake their hands and nod, they see the reason why

i'd like to make us at home, with a few chickens outside
if i keep on feeling this way, perhaps i'll soon get bored
and get back homr from where i came, and let this all pass
oh, anxious moments you have given me a few
still i'd like to get you alone just to know what you do
