        FORTUNE
	   MAYO THOMPSON


the bride sits down to breakfast in the dining room
she thought she a ghost but it was just really just the groom
"have you got a match?" she asked "that i can scratch?"
he asked for a little fire

nothing could be higher than a roof
oh, that you know, i think we both can agree
and there's no proof
that i got this roof to rely on

fortune, fates, and random chances
sure play a part in all romances
nothing that is given can be taken later on
someday you may try, meanwhile you sigh, pass the time

we could glide along the river
if you're in the mood
when the bells are breaking
and the ices make you shiver
don't let dogs bite you or let mirror get broken tonight
